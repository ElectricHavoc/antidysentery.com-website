### What am I listening to?
##### All times are Pacific Timezone
* ##### 12am to 12pm
    Kid safe mode, DJs will try hard to not play songs with curse words
* ##### Noon
    The first half of the Top Twenty Voted songs
* ##### 3pm
    The last half of the Top Twenty voted songs
* ##### 7pm
    The Burning Man Hour, playing only songs written about TTITD
### How to use chat
First enter your name. You can now chat with other users and request songs. Anything typed starting with a ! will be considered a command and will not post to the chat room. For example typing !new will queue the song with the least amount of plays.

#### What about the buttons?
The buttons on the bottom of the screen are
Play/Stop, Upvote, Downvote, Veto, and Chat Room
* ##### Upvote
    Yay! This will prevent the song from being vetoed and add it to the Top Twenty Voted Songs that play at noon. It will be saved and will play if you become a guest DJ.
* ##### Downvote
    Boo! This will show your dislike for the song. With enough downvotes the song will be removed from the playlist permanently.
* ##### Veto
    If the song is bad enough and you just can't take it anymore, Veto it! It takes one token to veto. Once the veto is accepted, Larry will spin the Wheel of Punishment, and it is anyones guess what happens after that. We live by the wheel, we die by the wheel. 

#### Tokens?
Yes, money. Earn tokens or have them gifted to you. Use tokens to veto songs, become a guest DJ, or gamble. 

#### How do I get more tokens?
You must enter a password to gain more tokens and to unlock advanced features. 
To set your password to hankey type in the chat... Don't forget it!
